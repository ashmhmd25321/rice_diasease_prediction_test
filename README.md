# Rice Disease Prediction Test

The Rice Disease Prediction Test is an Android app developed using Android Studio and Python. Its purpose is to detect diseases in rice plants using image recognition techniques. The app allows users to capture images of rice plants and predicts if they are affected by any diseases based on trained models.

## Features

- Image Recognition: The app uses image recognition algorithms to analyze the input images of rice plants and identify any diseases or abnormalities.
- Disease Classification: Based on the image analysis, the app classifies the rice plant as healthy or identifies the specific disease affecting it.
- User Interface: The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to capture images, view the prediction results, and explore additional information about the detected diseases.

## Technologies Used

- Android Studio: The app's user interface and functionality are implemented using Android Studio, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- Android Camera API: The Android Camera API is utilized to access the device's camera and capture images of rice plants.
- Python: Image recognition algorithms are implemented using Python. These algorithms analyze the input images and classify the rice plants based on trained models or deep learning techniques.
- Deep Learning Framework: The image recognition models may be developed using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras.
- Model Training: The models are trained using a labeled dataset of rice plant images, including healthy samples and samples affected by various diseases.
- Android Permissions: The app utilizes Android permissions to request access to the device's camera, necessary for capturing images.

## Installation and Usage

To use the Rice Disease Prediction Test app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

4. Grant the necessary camera permissions when prompted.

5. Capture an image of a rice plant using the app's camera interface.

6. Wait for the image recognition algorithms to process the captured image.

7. The app will display the prediction results, indicating whether the rice plant is healthy or affected by a specific disease.

8. Optionally, explore additional information or resources provided by the app about the detected diseases.

## Dataset and Model Training

The accuracy and performance of the rice disease prediction are highly dependent on the quality of the dataset used for training the models. The specific details of the dataset used and the training process are typically mentioned in the project's repository.

It's important to note that training accurate and reliable disease prediction models requires a diverse and well-labeled dataset, as well as expertise in data preprocessing, model architecture, and training techniques.
